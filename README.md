# CS 205: Project 1 - Nine Men in a Trench

Introduction
The “Nine Men in a Trench” puzzle was created by Henry Ernest Dudeney in 1917. The puzzle involves moving a grouping of numbered tiles from 1-9 within a line of 10 spaces and recesses connected to spaces 4, 6, and 8. The puzzle and space is meant to represent soldiers in a trench where the numbered tiles are people and the 1 tile is a sergeant. As it states in the book, “ Here are nine men in a trench. Number 1 is the sergeant, who wishes to place himself at the other end of the line-at point I-all the other men returning to their proper places as at present. There is no room to pass in the trench, and for a man to attempt to climb over another would be a dangerous exposure. But it is not difficult with those three recesses, each of which will hold a man… How is it to be done with the fewest possible moves? A man may go any distance that is possible in a move.” [1].

This project is the first of the CS 205: Artificial Intelligence class at University of California, Riverside for Spring 2025 Quarter. The class is taught by Professor Eamonn Keogh. The Nine  Men in a Trench problem is being solved in lieu of the 8-puzzle as I have taken CS 170 in my undergraduate courses.
